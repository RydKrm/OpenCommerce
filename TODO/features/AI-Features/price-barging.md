## 🎯 Feature: AI-Powered Bargaining Chatbot

### 🧩 Core Flow Example

integrating AI-powered price negotiation (bargaining) into your chatbot can significantly boost user engagement and conversion, especially in marketplaces or wholesale-type platforms.

```
Product listed at: $250
User offers: $100
Bot replies: " I can do $200, would that work for you?"
User rejects
Bot replies: "Alright, how about $150?"
Final threshold is $130, if user still refuses, bot says: "Sorry, this is the lowest I can go."
```
