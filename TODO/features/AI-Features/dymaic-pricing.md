## üî• Dynamic Pricing with AI

### üéØ Goal:

- Set optimal prices for products dynamically based on multiple factors like demand, competition, time, stock, or user behavior.

### ‚úÖ What It Can Do:

- Offer time-based discounts (e.g., flash sales)
- Increase prices for high-demand or low-stock items
- Offer different prices to new vs returning customers (optional)
- Compete with market rates

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Implement:

- 1. Collect Data:
     Product views, add-to-cart, purchases
- Inventory levels
- Time of day/week/month
- Competitor prices (if possible via scraping or API)

2. Model Suggestions:
   Linear/Logistic Regression (basic)

- XGBoost/Random Forest (good starting point)
- Reinforcement Learning (for more complex adaptive pricing)

3. Workflow:
   Train ML model on historical sales + product data

- Predict best price for current context
- Update product price via scheduled cron job or trigger-based system

4. Tools:
   ML: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM

- Python Service for price manager
- Redis (for caching recommended prices)
