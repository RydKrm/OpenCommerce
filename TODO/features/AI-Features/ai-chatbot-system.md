## 🧠 What Should the AI Chatbot Do?

Start by defining the core features. For an e-commerce platform, consider:

🔹 Customer Support
Order tracking (“Where is my order?”)

Return/refund help

Payment issues

FAQ responses (shipping, delivery times, etc.)

🔹 Product Recommendations
Suggest products by category or price range

Recommend based on browsing/purchase history

“What should I gift my friend?” type queries

🔹 Smart Search Assistant
“Show me affordable gaming laptops under $1000”

Fuzzy queries like “iphon accessories for travel”

🔹 Live Agent Hand-off
If the bot can't answer → route to human support
